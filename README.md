Food does not prey. It duplicates after a preset time after deployment. It is displayed as a green circle.
Consumer preys on Food and duplicates after satisfying an inner counter of food eaten. It dies when the counter goes down to zero. It is displayed as a red circle.
Predator preys on Consumer. It works same as Consumer. It is displayed as a purple circle.
